          practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices
          before deciding to use their services. Internal Service Providers We

          Requests We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other
          third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights
          fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the community from bad
          actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law
          enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal
          investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize
          us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email

          without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal
          procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
          information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or
          financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can
          (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city,
          state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to

          as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in
          connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property
          infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. Due to the existing
          regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private
          communications and other personal information will never be disclosed

          personal information to the government or third parties under certain
          circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
          transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse
