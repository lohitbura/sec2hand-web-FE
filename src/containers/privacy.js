          third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights
          fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the community from bad

          information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or
          financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can

          connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property
          infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. Due to the existing
